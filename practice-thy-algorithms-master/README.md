***practice-thy-algorithms*** is a series of specifications for practicing algorithms in the **Javascript** and **Ruby** programming languages.
To get started, just clone this repo.

## Ruby Instructions
Write your solutions in `algorithms.rb` and run the `rspec` command in the `Ruby` directory.

## Javascript Instructions
Open the `run_this.html` file in a web browser.
Your Javascript code goes in the `algorithms.js` file in the `src` directory.
